# My-Protfolio

## User Story
I made my first website for my protfolio! I posted my very first HTML coding website as one of the projects. More to come! This assignment was very fun and it really makes you thing. I love solving problems, especially the one I created within the code. Positioning, flex box, and the media query are the ones that really got to me. Working on this project taught me how to be patient, learn to take breaks, and have a clear mind to find the problem. CSS is a lot of trial and error, which I love, but it can be very frustrating. But, that is all apart of the process to becoming a good coder. I had to do my own investigation on how to solve my coding errors, and had a lot of advice from tutors and peers. I still have so much to learn. I will be tweaking this up more in the future when I learn more code.
